class DiracDelta(Distribution):
	"""A dirac delta distribution object.

	A dirac delta distribution is a probability distribution that has its entire
	density at zero. This distribution assumes that each feature is independent
	of the others. This means that, in practice, it will assign a zero
	probability if any value in an example is non-zero.

	There are two ways to initialize this object. The first is to pass in
	the tensor of alpha values representing the probability to return given a
	zero value, at which point they can immediately be
	used. The second is to not pass in the rate parameters and then call
	either `fit` or `summary` + `from_summaries`, at which point the probability
	parameter will be learned from data.


	Parameters
	----------
	alphas: list, numpy.ndarray, torch.Tensor or None, shape=(d,), optional
		The probability parameters for each feature. Default is None.

	inertia: float, [0, 1], optional
		Indicates the proportion of the update to apply to the parameters
		during training. When the inertia is 0.0, the update is applied in
		its entirety and the previous parameters are ignored. When the
		inertia is 1.0, the update is entirely ignored and the previous
		parameters are kept, equivalently to if the parameters were frozen.

	frozen: bool, optional
		Whether all the parameters associated with this distribution are frozen.
		If you want to freeze individual pameters, or individual values in those
		parameters, you must modify the `frozen` attribute of the tensor or
		parameter directly. Default is False.
